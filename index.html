    <p>My Name is Trey, I'm currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.  I am a beginner in Web Development, but look forward to the challenge and hope that I can learn many of these new skills.  Professionally, I have mostly been working in Management, Business Development and Sales. I have worked for both small and large companies and I also owned and operated my own company for about 10 years.  
   
    <p> I obtained a B.S. in Industrial Managament at Georgia Tech in the mid-90's and have found that background incredibly useful in just about everything I have been involved in. Good Management principles and practices generally go un-noticed, yet poor Management permeates through all levels of a Project and/or an Organization. </p> 

    <p>My experiences have touched many different fields and industries. I have been involved with Medical Devices and Technologies, Energy Technolgies, Water Purification, Agricultural Storage Containers, Agronomy and Turf Sciences.  In my personal life, I enjoy the outdoors and play as much golf as my free time will allow. I am married, have a 3 year old daughter and live in Cumming, Georgia.</p>
